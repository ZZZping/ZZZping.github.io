## SICP-Sqrt

The contrast between function and procedure is a reflection of the general distinction between describing properties
of things and describing how to do things, or, as it is sometimes referred to, the distinction between declarative
knowledge and imperative knowledge. In mathematics we are usually concerned with declarative(what is) descriptions whereas
in computer science we are usually concerned with imperative(how to) descriptions.

````lisp
; square 
(define (square x) (* x x))

; abs
(define (abs x) 
    (if ((< 0 x) (- x))
        (else x)))
